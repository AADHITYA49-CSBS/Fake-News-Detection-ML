Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify fake vs. real news articles using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression. The goal is to enhance misinformation detection by leveraging machine learning.

ðŸ“Œ Dataset
Due to file size limitations, dataset files are hosted on Google Drive:
